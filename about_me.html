        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Kris began working with computers in middle school, where his shop teacher let any kid who 
            could make a working computer from the scrap heap take it home.
        <br/> <br/>
            After months of tinkering and many scrapped knuckles, Kris got that computer working, and hasn't been far from one since.
        </p>
        <p>In the intervening years, Kris joined the military, got kicked out for having asthma, and joined the workforce. 
            He has worked for two telecoms, three software companies, and one electronics retailer. Through it all, he's supported
            an array of technologies and systems. Now, he's planning to take the wheel and start making some of his own.</p>
